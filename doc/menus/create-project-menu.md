# EstiMate - Create Project

A project groups estimated tasks together, so in order to start estimating, you need to create a project.
* First thing to set is the `project name`.
* Then you have to have a `short name` for the project, for example the short name for the project `Awesome Backend Code` could be `ABC`.
* And the last thing is `confidence interval`.

You can read more about `confidence interval` on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval).
For IT projects the default `95` is sufficient.
Simply put the `confidence interval` indicates the reliability of the estimates.

After you entered these information, an empty project is created for you, and you can start estimating tasks.
The project is always saved automatically in a JSON file in the folder you are running EstiMate.
