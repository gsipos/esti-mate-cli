# EstiMate - Modify task

In this menu you can edit a task's name, estimate or tags.
The inputs have the same rules as in the [task creation](./add-task-menu.md).
The changes automatically saved to the project json file.

### Selecting task
First you have to select a task from the list.
All the tasks are in the list, if the list is too big then the list scrolls as you move down.
Once you selected the task you want to edit, you'll be able to choose the desired action.

### Possible actions
* change task name
* change task estimation
* change task tags
* delete task
* or go back to [project menu](./project-menu.md)
